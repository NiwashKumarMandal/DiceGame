## Overview:
This Dice Roll project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the rolling of a six-sided dice commonly used in various board games and tabletop activities. Users can click a button to roll the dice and see the result displayed on the screen.

## Features:
- **Dice Rolling:** Users can simulate rolling a six-sided dice by clicking a button or pressing space bar.
- **Random Number Generation:** The application generates a random number between 1 and 6 each time the dice is rolled.
- **Visual Feedback:** Upon rolling the dice, users can see the result displayed on the screen. 

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML:** Markup language used for structuring the web page elements.
- **CSS:** Stylesheets used for styling the visual presentation of the dice roll interface.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language used for implementing the interactive functionality of the dice roll, including random number generation and DOM manipulation.</br>
